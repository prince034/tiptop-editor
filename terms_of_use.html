Terms of Use<br/>
These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of TipTop Information Technology Co., Ltd. (“TipTop”) services (“Services” or “TipTop”), and any information, text, graphics, photos or other materials uploaded, downloaded or appearing on the TipTop (collectively referred to as "Content") referencing these Terms. You can’t use our TipTop unless you agree to them, so please read them carefully. Before using any of the TipTop, you are required to read, understand and agree to these terms. You may only access the TipTop after reading and accepting these Terms of Use. <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
1. Your Agreement With TipTop.<br/>
1) Applicable Law. Your relationship is with TipTop, a United States company, and you agree to be bound by the laws of California and the laws of the United States.<br/>
2) Any information that you provide to TipTop is subject to our Privacy Policy, which governs our collection and use of your information. You understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information, including the transfer of this information to the United States and/or other countries for storage, processing and use by TipTop. As part of providing you the Services, we may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your TipTop account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving.<br/>
 <br/>
    <br/>
2. Privacy<br/>
The TipTop Privacy Policy is incorporated into these Terms. By accepting these Terms, you agree to the collection, use, and sharing of your information through the Services in accordance with the Privacy Policy.<br/>
 <br/>
    <br/>
3. User Content<br/>
The Services consist of interactive features and areas that allow users to create, post, transmit, and/or store content, including but not limited to photos, videos, text, graphics, items, or other materials (collectively, "User Content"). You understand that you are responsible for all data charges you incur by using the Services. You also understand that your User Content may be viewable by others and that you have the ability to control who can access such content by adjusting your privacy settings. And you agree to abide by our Community Guidelines, which may be updated from time to time.<br/>
You agree that you are solely responsible for your User Content and any claims arising therefrom, and that TipTop is not responsible or liable for any User Content or claims arising therefrom. While we are not obligated to do so, we reserve the right, and have absolute discretion, to review, screen, and delete User Content at any time and for any reason.<br/>
You retain all ownership rights in your User Content. However, by submitting User Content to TipTop, you hereby grant us an irrevocable, nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, create derivative works from, distribute, perform, promote, exhibit, and display such User Content in any and all media or distribution methods, now known or later developed (the "User Content License"), subject to any privacy settings you have set to control who can see your User Content.<br/>
 <br/>
    <br/>
4. Community Guidelines<br/>
Our goal in creating these rules is to accommodate the broadest range of self expression while balancing the need for TipTop users to be able to use our service safely and enjoyably.<br/>
Don't send people messages they don't want to receive-especially if the message is mean. Be thoughtful about what you send a message and whom you send it to.<br/>
Be thoughtful about what you send a message and whom you send it to. It's okay with us if someone takes a screenshot, but we can't speak for you or your friends. TipTop attempts to detect screenshots and notify the sender, but it doesn't always work perfectly - and your friend can always capture the image with a camera.<br/>
Keep it legal. Don't use TipTop for any illegal shenanigans and if you're under 18 or are messaging with someone who might be: keep your clothes on!<br/>
What not to send:<br/>
- Pornography<br/>
- Nudity or sexually suggestive content involving minors (people under the age of 18)<br/>
- Minors engaged in activities that are physically dangerous and harmful<br/>
- Invasions of privacy<br/>
- Threats<br/>
- Harassment or Bullying<br/>
- Impersonation<br/>
- Self-Harm<br/>
Violating these rules may result in the removal of content, the suspension of your account and being prohibited from using TipTop in the future. Please take these rules seriously and honor them in the spirit in which they are intended. The rules will change and evolve along with the TipTop user community. We will do our best to enforce them consistently and fairly, and ultimately we'll try to do what we think is best in each situation, at our own discretion.  <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
5. Feedback<br/>
You agree that any feedback, suggestions, ideas, or other information or materials regarding TipTop or the Services that you provide, whether by email or otherwise ("Feedback"), are non-confidential and shall become the sole property of TipTop. We will be entitled to the unrestricted use and dissemination of such Feedback for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without acknowledging or compensating you. You waive any rights you may have to the Feedback (including any copyrights or moral rights).
